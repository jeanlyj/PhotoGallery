# PhotoGallery
Test projects
This is a Photogallery project create with mongoDB and Laravel.
Users can regiser and login, create galleries add images,edit, and delete it.
The recent vesion only has single image upload function, I will update it to multiple images update later on.
Also, will create a function to import JSON data to the database and update the users information and galleries images.
Will continue working on the front-end optimization.
The deployment will be done untill completion of project.
